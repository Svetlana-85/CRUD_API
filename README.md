## Usage
Implemented endpoint api/users: 
`GET api/users` - to get all persons
`GET api/users/${userId}` - to get user by id
`POST api/users` - to create record about new user and store it in database
`PUT api/users/{userId}` - to update existing user
`DELETE api/users/${userId}` - to delete existing user from database
### Users are stored as objects that have following required properties:
`username` — user's name (string)
`age` — user's age (number)
`hobbies` — user's hobbies (array of strings or empty array)
